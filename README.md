# IsValidSubsequence

Given two non-empty arrays, determine if the second array is a subsequence of the first. A subsequent array is an array 
whose contents fit inside the first array by removing values from the first array only. For example:
[1,2,3,4,5]
[3,5]
The second array is generated by removing 1,2, and 4 from the first array.
[5,3] would not be a subsequent array because it requires removing numbers from the first array AND reordering them.
